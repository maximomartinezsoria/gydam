# Gydam
Gydam is a real-time IoT platform which allows you to send whatever data you want from one device to another.

Take a look at [rapsberry-temperature](https://github.com/maximomartinezsoria/gydam/tree/master/gydam-agent/examples/raspberry-temperature) example. Here the platform is reading temperature from a `ds18b20` sensor and sending it through the MQTT server.
